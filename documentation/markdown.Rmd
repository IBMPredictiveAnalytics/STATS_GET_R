STATS GET R Extension Command
==============================

Get information about an R workspace or create
an SPSS dataset from an R data frame.

STATS GET R
FILE="*filespec*" or &#42; CLEARENV=YES^&#42;&#42; or NO  
PACKAGE="*package name*" DATA="*R dataset name*"
ALLDATA=YES or NO^&#42;&#42;

/INFO NAMES=*list of names* or . CLASSES=*list of R class types* or .

/GET DATAFRAME=*dataframe* SERIES=*list of series* DATASET=*SPSS dataset name*.

STATS GET R /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default

Example:
```
STATS GET R FILE="c:/data/work.Rdata"
/GET DATAFRAME=results DATASET=results.
```

**FILE** specifies the name of the R workspace file.  &#42; can be used to refer to
a workspace file previously loaded by this command in the current session.

Alternatively, specify **PACKAGE** and **DATA** to restrict the items to
data in a particular package and dataset.  For example,  
```STATS GET R DATA="mammals" PACKAGE="MASS"```  
would return information from the *mammals* dataset in package *MASS*.

**ALLDATA**=YES produces a listing of all the R dataset by package and R data name.

**CLEARENV**, which defaults to YES, specifies whether or not to remove the
contents of the loaded workspace after the command is run.

You can use either the INFO subcommand or the GET subcommand in one
invocation but not both.  Typically you would start by using INFO
to find the contents of a workspace and then use GET to extract a data frame
and make an SPSS dataset.

If neither GET nor INFO is specified, contents information is displayed.

INFO
----
The INFO subcommand produces a pivot table displaying the contents of
the workspace filtered by NAMES and CLASSES specifications.

**NAMES** can be a list of names or one or more regular expressions.  For example
```NAMES=abc def``` would limit the information to R items with those names.
```NAMES="a.*" "b.*"``` would limit the output to names starting with *a* or
starting with *b*.  (The two regular expressions could, of course, be
combined into one in this example.)

**CLASSES** can specify a list of R object classes to limit the output.
Any classes can be listed, but the default is data.frame.

NOTE: Since R names are case sensitive, you must use the appropriate case
in setting these filters.

Use a period to indicate all names or all classes.

GET
---
The GET subcommand is used to create an SPSS dataset from an R data frame.
Specify the name via **DATAFRAME** or specify one or more series that can be
combined into a data frame via **SERIES**.

**DATASET** specifies the SPSS dataset name to be assigned to the new dataset.
The dataset name must not already be in use, and the current active file
should have a dataset name in order to keep it open when the new dataset
is created.

While most R names will be legal in Statistics, in case of difficulty enclose
the names in quotes.  When a dataset is created, a reasonable attempt is
made to make the data frame variable names into legal SPSS names.  If
the name is modified, the orginal name becomes the variable label.

If the series are all consistent time series, the time points
are used as the row names.  Otherwise the series are just numbered.
