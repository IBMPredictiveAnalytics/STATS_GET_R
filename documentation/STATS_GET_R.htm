  <h1>Get Information and Data from R Workspace or Dataset</h1>
  This procedure can do three things.  
  <p class="bullet">•Display a list of all datasets included
  with installed R packages.</p>
  <p class="bullet">•Display information about selected objects in an
  R workspace file or dataset</p>
  <p class="bullet">•Read an R data frame from a workspace or dataset and
  create a Statistics dataset from it.  It can also read a set of variables that
  can be converted into a data frame and create a Statistics dataset.</p>
  <p>Typical usage starts with finding the dataset or workspace file; then
  finding the names and types of objects in it, and finally creating an
  SPSS dataset from a data frame or set of series.</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">R Workspace or Dataset</span> Select the source to be used.
  It can be an R workspace file or a dataset distributed with an R package.
  If this command has already been run in this session, and it loaded a workspace
  or dataset that is still in memory, you can check the second box to use that as the source.
  </p>
  <p>Datasets are associated with packages.  To use a package dataset, enter
  the package and dataset names.  Only installed packages can be selected.
  Datasets in base R are in the <i>datasets</i> package.</p>


  <p><span class="runinhead">List all package datasets</span> Check this box
  to produce a table listing all the datasets in the installed packages.  The
  listing includes the package name, the dataset name, and a title.  If the dataset name
  includes a parenthesized string, e. g., <i>BJsales.lead (BJsales)</i>, use the text inside
  the parentheses to refer to the dataset when loading it.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Clear workspace after use</span> Check this box to
  remove the workspace or data from memory after this command completes.</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Task</span> Choose whether to display information
  about the contents of the workspace or dataset or to create a Statistics dataset
  from an appropriate object.  
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Display contents information</span> 
  By default, information about all data frames
  is displayed.  You can filter the names by entering one or more specific names
  in the Name Filter field or by entering a regular expression such as "x.*" to
  limit the information to matching names.  This example would list all the objects
  whose name starts with x and satisfy the class filter.
  <p>You can select the object classes for the output by entering one or more class
  names in the Class Filter.  Use "." to request all classes.  The list of possible
  R classes is open ended, but common ones include "data.frame", "list", "matrix",
  and "function".</p>
  <p class="bullet">• Names in R are case sensitive. </p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Create Statistics Dataset</span>
  Choose this button to create a Statistics dataset corresponding to an R data frame or
  a set of compatible series.  Enter a data frame name in the Data Frame field or
  one or more series names in the Series to Combine field.  Enter a name for the
  Statistics dataset in the Dataset Name field.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of converting a data frame to a dataset, you can specify a list of
  variables in the R workspace or dataset.  They will be combined into a data frame
  which is then imported.  All the variables must have the same number of cases.</p>
  
  <p>A reasonable effort is made to map R variable names to legal Statistics names,
  but some unusual names may cause the extraction to fail.  If the Statistics name
  differs from the R name, the R name is used as the variable label.</p>
  <p class="bullet">• The dataset name must not already be in use. </p>


  <h2>Additional Features</h2>

  <p>This dialog generates syntax for the STATS GET R extension
  command. To display the syntax help, run the following
  command.</p>

  <p class="codeblock">STATS GET R /HELP.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>This command requires the R Essentials and at
  least version 18 of IBM SPSS Statistics.
  You can download the Essentials from the SPSS Community website
  at www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral.<br>
